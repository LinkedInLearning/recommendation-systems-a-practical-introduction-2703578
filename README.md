Recommendation systems are among the most profitable artificial intelligence solutions you can deploy, for the simple fact that they can understand what people want amid a seemingly endless number of options. Anytime you buy—or browse—online, there are probably recommendation systems at work presenting you with options at each step. In this course, Miguel González-Fierro teaches some of the techniques used for building, deploying, and testing recommenders. He offers practical, real-world examples to show how you can make a direct impact with recommendation systems, whether you’re a data scientist, machine learning engineer, data engineer, software engineer, or data analyst. Join Miguel in this course to get started building your first recommender and see how high it can boost your metrics.
